# Supplier Trust Desk: P4, governed supplier changes

Exam project (SRH M.Sc. ACS, GenAI and SAP Fiori, November 2026). All companies, people and data are fictional.

P4 lets a company change supplier master data (name, tax number, address) safely. A requester asks for a change; the system judges the risk:

- **Low risk** (a street, house-number or postal-code fix, at most 2 fields) is applied on submit by the requester alone, checked and recorded.
- **Medium risk** (name, tax number, city, country, or a low change that escalates) waits for a data steward. Nobody can approve their own request (four-eyes).
- A low change escalates to medium when more than 2 fields change, when the supplier already had 2 applied changes in the last 30 days, or when the supplier is on payment hold.
- Only one submitted request per supplier and field at a time; a second one gets `409` (also when two arrive at the same moment).

P4's database is also the central store for the group's other apps: P2 (invoice decisions) and P3 (data issues) reach it through a narrow integration API.

## Architecture

| Piece | What it does | Configured in |
|---|---|---|
| Fiori elements apps | Five role-based apps, a launch page and a printable meeting report | `app/` |
| App Router | Front door: login, serves the apps with a role check per app folder, forwards `/odata/…` to the service | `.deploy/app-router/xs-app.json` |
| XSUAA | SAP login and roles | `xs-security.json` |
| CAP service (Node.js) | One OData V4 service per role, plus the business rules | `srv/` (rules in `srv/lib/change-rules.js`) |
| SAP HANA Cloud (HDI container) | The data | `db/` (model and seed data) |
| MTA | Build and deploy description | `mta.yaml` |

Services: `/odata/v4/requests` (Requester), `/odata/v4/approvals` (DataSteward), `/odata/v4/suppliers` (all roles), `/odata/v4/insights` (DataSteward, Auditor), `/odata/v4/config` (RuleAdmin), `/odata/v4/user` (who am I), `/odata/v4/integration` (technical client of P2/P3 only; it cannot approve anything).

## Roles and apps

| Role | App(s) |
|---|---|
| Requester | My Supplier Change Requests |
| DataSteward | Approve Supplier Changes, Supplier Change Insights, change report |
| Auditor | Supplier Change Insights, change report (read only) |
| RuleAdmin | Rules and Settings (postal-code rules, risk tiers, settings, thresholds) |
| All roles | Supplier Master Data (read only: suppliers change only through a request) |

## Run and test locally

Prerequisites: Node.js 20 or later (developed with CAP `@sap/cds` 10.2).

    npm install
    npm test          # 47 tests (API rules, roles, risk tiers, integration API)
    npx cds watch     # http://localhost:4004, SQLite in memory, mocked users

Local users (mocked, local only; the password equals the user name): `rita`, `raj` (Requester), `sam` (DataSteward), `mixa` (Requester + DataSteward, for the four-eyes test), `aud` (Auditor), `ops` (RuleAdmin), `p2app`, `p3app` (Integration), `nobody` (no role). In the cloud, XSUAA replaces them.

`test/requests.http` has example calls.

## Build and deploy to SAP BTP (Cloud Foundry)

Prerequisites: a Cloud Foundry space with entitlements for SAP HANA Cloud (`hdi-shared`) and XSUAA (`application`), a running SAP HANA Cloud instance mapped to that space, the cf CLI with the MultiApps plugin, and the Cloud MTA Build Tool (`mbt`). Developed with `@sap/approuter` 23.4.0.

    mbt build -t gen --mtar mta.tar     # npm ci, cds build --production, copies the apps for the App Router
    cf deploy gen/mta.tar -f            # the service starts only after the database step (deployed-after)

The deploy creates the role collections `Requester`, `DataSteward`, `Auditor` and `RuleAdmin` (`… (supplier-mdcr <org>-<space>)`); assign them to users in the BTP cockpit under Security → Role Collections.

Notes:

- The cloud configuration is final: do not run `cds add …` again (`cds add approuter` would rewrite `xs-app.json`).
- Seed files in `db/data` use `;` between columns: never put a `;` inside a text.
- On a trial account, SAP stops the apps and the HANA instance every day. Start the HANA instance first, then `cf start supplier-mdcr-srv` and `cf start supplier-mdcr`.

## Security

No passwords, keys or tokens are stored in this repository. The P2/P3 service-key values are kept only in a password manager.
